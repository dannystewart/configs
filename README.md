# Code Configs

This repo hosts my preferred configs for all my various coding tools. It also contains a script that will download them and compare them to any matching files in the current directory, showing a diff and updating them as needed. This is to ensure that I always have my latest configs in all my projects.

The script also saves the updated configs to the repository's root, thereby creating a virtuous cycle where the repo is always up-to-date with the latest versions of the config files for other projects to pull from.
